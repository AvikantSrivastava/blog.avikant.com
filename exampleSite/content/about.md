I am a final year student currently working at HackerRank as a SWE Intern. With hands on experience in Software Development and Machine Learning, I have worked on mutiple end-to-end projects

I have good understanding of building scalable Backend systems and Microservices in Python, Go, Ruby and Node js, currently exploring System Design, DevOps and Infrastructure Engineering 💻

I love to talk about about technology and mentor students. Always up for working on new and creative idea, learning new skills and building rockstart projects ✨

Apart of tech stuff, I enjoy watching Anime and Formula 1 on weekends 🏎️
